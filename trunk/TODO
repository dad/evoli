* move tools.hh from directory folder into directory tools (Claus)

* place the logic of when a protein is stably folded into folder classes (Claus)
	- break up FoldInfo into two separate classes. The basic FoldInfo should only know
	  whether the molecule is stably folded, but not know about DeltaG and StructureID.
	  Those quantities make already assumptions about the specific method of folding.

	- Once the new structure is fully put into place, the function isFoldedBelowThreshold()
	  in the CompactLatticeFolder would better fit into a separate class (say a subclass of
	  the CompactLatticeFolder), where it could replace the fold() function.

* modify Population so that it can handle fitness models where the same sequence may
  have different fitnesses at different points in time (Claus)

* separate Folder-dependent functions from gene-util, and put them into a folder-util. (Claus)

* refactor GenebankAnalyzer: separate organisms-specific code from generic code. (?)

* make function ErrorproneTranslation::getCodonCosts() not return a pointer
  to an internal data structure. (?)

* convert calcOutcomes(...) and countOutcomes(...) to return a data structure 
  rather than modifying a large set of incoming references (Allan)

* refactor files to adhere to one-class-one-file paradigm (Allan)
