* place the logic of when a protein is stably folded into folder classes (Claus)
	- break up FoldInfo into two separate classes. The basic FoldInfo should only know
	  whether the molecule is stably folded, but not know about DeltaG and StructureID.
	  Those quantities make already assumptions about the specific method of folding.

	- Once the new structure is fully put into place, the function isFoldedBelowThreshold()
	  in the CompactLatticeFolder would better fit into a separate class (say a subclass of
	  the CompactLatticeFolder), where it could replace the fold() function.

* modify Population so that it can handle fitness models where the same sequence may
  have different fitnesses at different points in time (Claus)

* make function ErrorproneTranslation::getCodonCosts() not return a pointer
  to an internal data structure. (?)

* convert calcOutcomes(...) and countOutcomes(...) to return a data structure 
  rather than modifying a large set of incoming references (Allan)

* refactor files to adhere to one-class-one-file paradigm (Allan)

After the implementation of the new polymerase class, these things still need to be done:
- Update binary tests. All the binary tests of the tr-driver program now break, because the new polymerase uses random numbers differently (even if mutation frequencies are homogeneous).

- The test program in src/gene should be removed, and the functions in there integrated into the regression test suite.


* convert programs with long command lines to either use flags or an input file.  Consider using Boost? http://www.boost.org/doc/html/program_options.html (?)
